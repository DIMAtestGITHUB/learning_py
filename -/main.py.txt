a = 10 # int variable: "int means - Integer". 
       # We can put into this variable just number like"1,2,3..."

b = "10" # it's string variable can contain symbol ("") or ('') which say Inteprеter, 
    # "hay I have string" but this variable cannot be (10, asdasd, 123) without (""), ('').     

c = 10.5 # this is the float variable. Float is the desemal nomber like 1.2 ...

# Python it's language where we don't need write what type of variable you need,
# but we can transformate integer into string or float

# example

# variable a = 10 it's integer. We can con:vert into str - String
d = str(a)

# type(variable) - function show what type variables do you have.

# it is just note for which variable we cheking 
print("variable: a")

# it is just for understandeble what type of variable do we have 
print(type(a))

# it is just note for which variable we cheking 
print("variable: d")

# it is just for understandeble what type of variable do we have 
print(type(d))

# list it's like variable but that can conteinnig not just number.
# We can put into the list: number - integer , string, float and another list

List = [1,"1",1.2]

# We can add or remove items

# here We are add item.
List.append("1")

my_dictionary = {} # this is a dictionary. "{}" say for python what that means a dictionary, so if we have for example variable
                   # "number_of_phone = {}". So that mean a dictionary.
# dicrionary "my_dictionary" can contain key word and value for example:

my_dictionary = {"Dima":"19 years old"}
# print all dictionary
print(my_dictionary)

# now we print just value
print(my_dictionary["Dima"]) # in [] we put what do you want to know about these key word
