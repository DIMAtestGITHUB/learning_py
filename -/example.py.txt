a = 10 #int variable "int means - Integer". 
       #We can put into this variable just number like"1,2,3..."

b = "10" #it's string variable can contain symbol ("") or ('') which say Inteprеter, 
    #"hay I have string" but this variable cannot be (10, asdasd, 123) without (""), ('').     

c = 10.5 # this is the float variable. Float is the desemal nomber like 1.2 ...

# Python it's language where we don't need write what type of variable you need,
# but we can transformate integer into string or float

#example

#variable a = 10 it's integer we convert into str - String
d = str(a)


print("d")
print(type(d))
print("a")
print(type(a))
print(d)
print(a)
#errors
print(a+b)
